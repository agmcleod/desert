/**
 * <Route> components specify components that are rendered to the page when the
 * URL matches a given pattern.
 *
 * Routes are arranged in a nested tree structure. When a new URL is requested,
 * the tree is searched depth-first to find a route whose path matches the URL.
 * When one is found, all routes in the tree that lead to it are considered
 * "active" and their components are rendered into the DOM, nested in the same
 * order as they are in the tree.
 *
 * The preferred way to configure a router is using JSX. The XML-like syntax is
 * a great way to visualize how routes are laid out in an application.

 *     <Routes handler={App}>
 *       <Route name="login" handler={Login}/>
 *       <Route name="logout" handler={Logout}/>
 *       <Route name="about" handler={About}/>
 *     </Routes>
 *   ), document.body);
 *
 * If you don't use JSX, you can also assemble a Router programmatically using
 * the standard React component JavaScript API.
 *
 *   React.renderComponent((
 *     Routes({ handler: App },
 *       Route({ name: 'login', handler: Login }),
 *       Route({ name: 'logout', handler: Logout }),
 *       Route({ name: 'about', handler: About })
 *     )
 *   ), document.body);
 *
 * Handlers for Route components that contain children can render their active
 * child route using the activeRouteHandler prop.
