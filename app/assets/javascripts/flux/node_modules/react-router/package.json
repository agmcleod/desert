For example, `0.4.1` and `0.4.8` will have the same API, but\n`0.5.0` will have breaking changes.\n\nPlease refer to the [upgrade guide](/UPGRADE_GUIDE.md) and\n[changelog](/CHANGELOG.md) when upgrading.\n\n### App Dependencies\n\nWe use the following dependencies from npm:\n\n- `when` for promises\n- `events` for event emitters.\n\nIt is likely that your app will need dependencies like these. We\nrecommend you use the same modules that the router uses to decrease the\noverall size of your application.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n```sh\nnpm install react-router\n# or\nbower install react-router\n```\n\nThis library is written with CommonJS modules. If you are using\nbrowserify, webpack, or similar, you can consume it like anything else\ninstalled from npm.\n\nThere is also a global build available on bower, find the library on\n`window.ReactRouter`.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- Nested views mapped to nested routes\n- Modular construction of route hierarchy\n- Sync and async transition hooks\n- Transition abort / redirect / retry\n- Dynamic segments\n- Query parameters\n- Links with automatic `.active` class when their route is active\n- Multiple root routes\n- Hash or HTML5 history (with fallback) URLs\n- Declarative Redirect routes\n- Declarative NotFound routes\n- Browser scroll behavior with transitions\n\nCheck out the `examples` directory to see how simple previously complex UI\nand workflows are to create.\n\nWhat's it look like?\n--------------------\n\n```js\nReact.renderComponent((\n  <Routes location=\"history\">\n    <Route path=\"/\" handler={App}>\n      <DefaultRoute handler={Home} />\n      <Route name=\"about\" handler={About} />\n      <Route name=\"users\" handler={Users}>\n        <Route name=\"recent-users\" path=\"recent\" handler={RecentUsers} />\n        <Route name=\"user\" path=\"/user/:userId\" handler={User} />\n        <NotFoundRoute handler={UserRouteNotFound}/>\n      </Route>\n    </Route>\n    <NotFoundRoute handler={NotFound}/>\n    <Redirect path=\"company\" to=\"about\" />\n  </Routes>\n), document.body);\n```\n\nAll of the `handler`s will render inside their parent route `handler`.\n\nSee more in the [overview guide](/docs/guides/overview.md).\n\nBenefits of This Approach\n-------------------------\n\n1. **Incredible screen-creation productivity** - There is only one\n   use-case when a user visits a route: render something. Every user\n   interface has layers (or nesting) whether its a simple navbar or\n   multiple levels of master-detail. Coupling nested routes to these\n   nested views gets rid of a ton of work for the developer to wire all\n   of it together when the user switches routes. Adding new screens\n   could not get faster.\n\n2. **Immediate understanding of application structure** - When routes\n   are declared in one place, developers can easily construct a mental\n   image of the application. It's essentially a sitemap. There's not a\n   better way to get so much information about your app this quickly.\n\n3. **Code tractability** - When a developer gets a ticket to fix a bug\n   at as specific url they simply 1) look at the route config, then 2)\n   go find the handler for that route. Every entry point into your\n   application is represented by these routes.\n\n4. **URLs are your first thought, not an after-thought** - With React\n   Router, you don't get UI on the page without configuring a url first.\n   Fortunately, its wildly productive this way, too.\n\nRelated Modules\n---------------\n\n- [rnr-constrained-route](https://github.com/bjyoungblood/rnr-constrained-route) - validate paths\n  and parameters on route handlers.\n- [react-router-bootstrap](https://github.com/mtscout6/react-router-bootstrap) - Integration with [react-bootstrap](https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap) components.\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nPlease see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\nThanks, Ember\n-------------\n\nThis library is highly inspired by the Ember.js routing API. In general,\nits a translation of the Ember router api to React. Huge thanks to the\nEmber team for solving the hardest part already.\n\n",
